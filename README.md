# mit-6.00.1x-2019
Temporary repository for code written in MIT's edX 6.00.1x course in 2019.

All code was written in Python using the Spyder IDE. The actual problem set questions are not in the text files, only the answers. The problem set questions can be found by searching for the archived course.
